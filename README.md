# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Overview

Credit card fraud is a significant problem for financial institutions and consumers. This project aims to build an automated system that can flag potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using [algorithm name, e.g. Random Forest]
- Real-time prediction API
- Performance evaluation metrics

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/princemsd007/Credit-Card-Fraud/.git
2.  Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare your data:
- Ensure your dataset is in CSV format
- Place it in the `data/` directory

2. Train the model: python train_model.py
3.  Make prediction : python predict.py --input your_transaction_data.csv


## Data

The model is trained on the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features are transformed using PCA.

## Model

We use a [your chosen algorithm] to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The model achieves [your accuracy/F1 score] on the test set.
